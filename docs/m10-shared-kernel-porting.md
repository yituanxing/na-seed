# Shared kernel, architecture-owned mechanisms

The porting goal is one reusable NaSeed kernel, not separate M0 user kernels.
NaOS (kadds/NaOS) was inspected for its single kernel initialization,
arch/task split, shared ELF load_common and scheduler-policy boundary.
Its x86-specific paging.h is not a multiarch page-table contract.

## Whole-codebase audit; uncompleted integration blockers

- Build/boot: Makefile and kernel/kernel.c use NASEED_PORT_M0 to bypass
  the real init, VM, process, FS and syscall modules for RV64 and ARM64.
  Rework to ONE shared object set plus ISA-specific entry and linker logic.
- MMU: kernel/arch/mmu.h selects x86 only. A semantic VM contract must
  distinguish VA bounds, RWX, mapped frame ownership, root cloning/switching,
  TLB and selectable RV Sv39/48/57 without exposing ISA PTE bits.
- Context/process: kernel/arch/context.h and saved syscall frame are x86.
  Architecture-owned trap/user entry and FPU/TLS are required; one task
  registry, scheduler and process lifecycle must be preserved.
- ABI: kernel/nr.h and kernel/fs/syscall.c are x86-specific. Decode each ISA
  syscall register/number to named semantic IDs and pack stat/dirent/signal
  types by ABI. Unsupported calls must return -ENOSYS.
- ELF/exec: share structural validation and program loading through VM,
  keep one transactional exec implementation. This change begins the
  common validator and target ABI metadata; mapping logic not yet unified.
- Serial: separate SBI, semihost and COM1 transports behind a device model.

## Integration gates (NOT yet passed)
1. The SAME kernel/task/process/exec/FS/VM objects must compile and link
   for x86-64, RV64 and AArch64; no port-only userspace substitute.
2. Same source-level workload tested on each target using its native ELF,
   Linux ABI adapter and actual QEMU. The current static-vs-dynamic
   ladder is retained only as tests, not new kernel implementations.
3. Existing x86 authentic Bash/BusyBox and RV/ARM real-QEMU regressions
   must stay green during migration, and page-table mode variants tested.
4. After shared VM is used on RV, retire RV-private segment-map
   orchestration. Never copy filesystem, process or scheduler code.

## This change
- Single validated ELF64 header/PHDR parser used by x86 and RV64.
- ELF machine, musl interpreter, UTS machine and temporary stack/VM
  policy centralised in arch/abi.h for three ISA targets.
- Existing process/exec/loader/filesystem code reuses that descriptor.
- Real workload regressions preserved; host test rejects malformed ELF
  and accepts architecture IDs 62, 243 and 183.
